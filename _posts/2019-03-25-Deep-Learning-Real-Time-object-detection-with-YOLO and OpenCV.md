**You only look once** ([YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.

As per official Yolo site:

"Our model has several advantages over classifier-based systems. It looks at the whole image at test time so its predictions are informed by global context in the image. It also makes predictions with a single network evaluation unlike systems like [R-CNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn) which require thousands for a single image. This makes it extremely fast, more than 1000x faster than R-CNN and 100x faster than [Fast R-CNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn). See our [paper](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf) for more details on the full system."

Object detector is a combination of **object locator** and **object recognizer** and Yolo does this by runing forward the whole image only once through the deep neural network ([DNN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5207-deep-neural-networks-for-object-detection.pdf)).

## Realtime Object Detection

We will use OpenCV for this, especially DNN, Yolov3, [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/). And since we are going to use Python, OpenCV provides a good port for Darknet.

I am using Python3 though have earlier have used OpenCV with Python2 versions as well and it just works fine.

## Preparation/Setup

### Install OpenCV

Good intro to OpenCV there on https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html

[Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/) have published a detailed step by step guide on his blog [pip install opencv](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/19/pip-install-opencv/)

Once you have installed Python and OpenCV, you should see below;

```python
$ workon
cv
dl4cv
$ workon cv
(cv) $ python
Python 3.7.4 (default, Mar  24 2019, 18:13:23) 
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import cv2
>>> cv2.__version__
'4.1.0'
>>> 
```

I'm also using a great utility by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/) called **imutils** that has many very useful OpenCV utilities.

### Download Pre-trained Models

Create a project directory e.g. yolo-realtime-object-detection and download the following files to yolo-realtime-object-detection/model directory (or whatever name you prefer).

>  Pre-trained networkâ€™s weights (this is ~250mb in size). yolov3.weights - [https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

> Network configuration. yolov3.cfg - [https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg?raw=true](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg?raw=true)

> Names from COCO dataset. coco.names - [https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names?raw=true](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names?raw=true)

## Object Detection

Initialise OpenCV/DNN with Darknet with COCO dataset:

```
net = cv.dnn.readNetFromDarknet("yolov3.cfg", "yolov3.weights")
net.setPreferableBackend(cv.dnn.DNN_BACKEND_OPENCV)
net.setPreferableTarget(cv.dnn.DNN_TARGET_CPU)
```

Initialise video stream:

```python
# create window and start video stream to capture images
cv.namedWindow(windowName, cv.WINDOW_NORMAL)
vs = VideoStream(src=0).start()
cv.resizeWindow(windowName, 800, 600)
```

Capture and process video stream (images), pass through DNN and filter objects based on confident level:

```python
# grab the frame from video stream
frame = vs.read()

# create blob from frame.
blob = cv.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1/255, (inputWidth, inputHeight), [0,0,0], 1, crop=False)

# set input to the network
net.setInput(blob)

# forward pass to get output of the output layers
outs = net.forward(getLayerNames(net))

# process output
processOutput(frame, outs)

# show output
cv.imshow(windowName, frame)
```

Recently I've added code on Git, here is my python code for yolo-realtime-object-detection [https://github.com/manmohanp/machineintelligence/tree/master/yolo-realtime-object-detection](https://github.com/manmohanp/machineintelligence/tree/master/yolo-realtime-object-detection)

```bash
(cv) $ python detect_object.py
```

This should initiate your native camera and detect objects.

Here is an output;

![demo](https://manmohanp.github.io/assets/img/obj_detection_4.png)(https://manmohanp.github.io/assets/img/obj_detection_4.mp4)

Thats it!! This can detect 80 objects that are in COCO dataset.

Next is to add custom objects for detection.
